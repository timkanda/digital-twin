I dedicated extra hours to documentation and tutorials, built small proof-of-concept features, and asked questions during code reviews. Within two weeks, I was contributing full features independently."

I focus on delivering the most critical functionality first while keeping stakeholders informed."

I'd implement JWT or session-based auth with secure httpOnly cookies, role-based access control for authorization, and password hashing with bcrypt. For sensitive operations, I'd add rate limiting and audit logging."

Then I'd check logs and monitoring to identify the root cause, implement a quick fix or rollback if available, test the fix thoroughly, and deploy with proper verification. Finally, I'd document the incident and discuss prevention measures in a retrospective."
